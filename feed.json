It starts with students collecting their own data. And then both students and mentors create various types of images, provides a lot of interesting visualizations.</p>\n<p>Different from general datasets, this specific project dataset collects interesting variables like self-esteem, horoscope, psychology factors (intravert or extravert; optimist or pessmisit), Superpower and more.</p>\n<p>With the power of Tableau, I'm able to have some quick insight on this data.</p>\n<p><br><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://Cococatty.github.io/media/posts/6/Tableau-Children.png\" alt=\"A nested table\" width=\"1274\" height=\"811\"></p>\n<p>In this workseet, I want to have a view of how the distribution is like in terms of Career vs Students' horosocopes and their chosen subjects. It is very interesting to see some students who have the same horoscopes want to be in highly simliar industries regardless of their genders.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://Cococatty.github.io/media/posts/6/Tableau-Children2.png\" alt=\"Bubble\" width=\"901\" height=\"800\">In above visualization, I want to see the relationship between Gender and Students' desired Superpower. With a quick glance at this chart, I have to say, flying is really a top skill! Also, from this superpower, I can see at least one task at Data Cleansing stage - conslidate multiple levels of factor that point to the same thing into one, and remove the case sensitivity in variable values. For example, some students write \"Flying\" while some write \"fly\", they can both be \"Flying\".</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://Cococatty.github.io/media/posts/6/Tableau-Children3.png\" alt=\" mosaic plot\" width=\"1410\" height=\"797\">In this Mosaic plot, I'm trying to obtain an insight of children self-esteem and the top two activities they spend time at. The plot is not very straightforward as it could be, because of the number of levels in both variables. However, this potentially can be solved by grouping self-esteem into 2 or 3 classes, which I will try later.</p>\n<p>After the exploration, I found the data richness is much higher than I expected!</p>\n<p>I could not carry out all analysis at one go given my busy schedule. However, this quick playaround has clearly indicated me some data cleansinig tasks and potential topics to be discussed in the future!</p>\n<p>I highly recommend reading Laura's project posts. I was much inspired by them!

EDA is not a simple concept either. It turns out to be very important because it shows the hidden data characteristics (if right methods are applied!), it would guide you what to do next (missing data? class imbalance?). EDA is a skilled techniques because it requires attention to details, so that you can see the messages by using the right forms.</p>\n<p>I had been underestimated the power of EDA, thought it is a generic process to ALL projects. But in this journey, I found EDA is similar to DNA - a pair might share exactly the same content, but the chance is pretty low (good for confidence interval estimation thou!).</p>\n<p>I'm happy that I no longer using the same EDA techniques over my different projects, but start tailoring and thinking over it for EACH project!</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"mcetoc_1djj1tb4p4\">Shiny</h2>\n<h3 id=\"mcetoc_1djj1tb4p5\">Dynamic number of plots x googleVis Package</h3>\n<div>\n<p>I used googleVis package before but not in a very dynmaic manner.

After correcting the formulas to use the right outcome variables, everything RAN!</p>\n<p>Next time I will write down the question on a piece of paper to remind myself what I am trying to solve so that I would not be lost because of heavy and intensive development.</p>\n</div>",
