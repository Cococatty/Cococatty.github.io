            "content_html": "<p>One night I was doing project planning and information gathering for my assignment, then I found a piece of treasure!</p>\n\n<p>Such treasure has been kindly shared by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauragraceellis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Laura Ellis</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.littlemissdata.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Little Miss Data</a>, on her well-organized website. This project was initialized by Laura and her friend, Katherine who is a school teacher. It starts with students collecting their own data. And then both students and mentors create various types of images, provides a lot of interesting visualizations.</p>\n<p>Different from general datasets, this specific project dataset collects interesting variables like self-esteem, horoscope, psychology factors (intravert or extravert; optimist or pessmisit), Superpower and more.</p>\n<p>With the power of Tableau, I'm able to have some quick insight on this data.</p>\n<p><br><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://Cococatty.github.io/media/posts/6/Tableau-Children.png\" alt=\"A nested table\" width=\"1274\" height=\"811\"></p>\n<p>In this workseet, I want to have a view of how the distribution is like in terms of Career vs Students' horosocopes and their chosen subjects. It is very interesting to see some students who have the same horoscopes want to be in highly simliar industries regardless of their genders.</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://Cococatty.github.io/media/posts/6/Tableau-Children2.png\" alt=\"Bubble\" width=\"901\" height=\"800\">In above visualization, I want to see the relationship between Gender and Students' desired Superpower. With a quick glance at this chart, I have to say, flying is really a top skill! Also, from this superpower, I can see at least one task at Data Cleansing stage - conslidate multiple levels of factor that point to the same thing into one, and remove the case sensitivity in variable values. For example, some students write \"Flying\" while some write \"fly\", they can both be \"Flying\".</p>\n<p><img class=\"post__image--center\" src=\"https://Cococatty.github.io/media/posts/6/Tableau-Children3.png\" alt=\" mosaic plot\" width=\"1410\" height=\"797\">In this Mosaic plot, I'm trying to obtain an insight of children self-esteem and the top two activities they spend time at. The plot is not very straightforward as it could be, because of the number of levels in both variables. However, this potentially can be solved by grouping self-esteem into 2 or 3 classes, which I will try later.</p>\n<p>After the exploration, I found the data richness is much higher than I expected!</p>\n<p>I could not carry out all analysis at one go given my busy schedule. However, this quick playaround has clearly indicated me some data cleansinig tasks and potential topics to be discussed in the future!</p>\n<p>I highly recommend reading Laura's project posts. I was much inspired by them!
