# What is with this look :satisfied:

A new look of my portfolio website has been longggg overdue which was caused by a lack of proper personal device. Thanks to the arrival of a suitable device, I could finally conduct the relevant research, carried out the required setup and finished the initial new look.

# Tech Stack
This site is built based on a free [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) template. Compared to Gatsby, which my old website used, HUGO has the advantage of wider users range and more updated templates.

In this version of my website, I want to display my capabilities from various aspects. This means a blog style website would no longer meet the purpose. In the meanwhile, I do want to keep things nice and simple. After giving a few rounds of brainstorm, here are the key points:
* Research timeframe. The template research timeframe shall be limited to 6 hours. (Otherwise nothing will get done! :joy:)
* Simplicity. The final product shall allow me to post new objects easily, nothing more complicated than previous Gatsby version.
* Structure. Ideally posts can be grouped by topics/tags; 
* ZERO COST pleaseeeee!
* UI: definitely not blog style. Perhaps something towards 1-page website for the homepage?
* UI: Contact form is required. I can build the contact form, but it'd save so much time and effort just to find a template that already has contact form.
* UI: Theme light change button.
* UI: Moving/floating objects -> prefer not...

After a full 6-hour research, I have settled with HUGO and am impressed by how simple it is! I came across HUGO few years ago when I built my previous website. But the fancy Gatsby templates at the time stole me :face_with_peeking_eye:

I shall call an end to this post as I'm trying to increase the use of my website by writing bite-size posts with higher update frequencies, rather than longggg and infrequent update. In the next post, I will share more details of this development, and potentially a quick guideline (no promises thou :smirk:).

See ya in the next post!
